# 🐈‍⬛ Hello, Wanderer 💫  

I’m maneko—a self-taught and aspiring **developer, game dev, and pixel artist**.

## 🦇 What I Love 
🖤 **Game Development** – Crafting strange and fascinating little worlds for you to enjoy.  
🖤 **Web Development** – Creating online diarys and journals for you to girlblog your heart out.  
🖤 **Pixel Art** – Because tiny, moody sprites deserve all the love too.  

## 🌙 Forever Learning  
I am always looking for ways to forge and develop new skills or hobbies. Never bored over here!

## 🔮 Seeking Kindred Spirits  
Freelance work? Collabs? Chatting about cute aesthetics and game mechanics? I’m always up for it. Let’s create something cool together.
